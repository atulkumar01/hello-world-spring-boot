Problem Statement:
Create a simple Spring Boot application with REST endpoints to:
Return a hello message


Greet a user by name (query param)


Calculate square of a number (path variable)


Return grade based on marks (query param)


Format a date from input


Combine path variable and query param in one endpoint


No database needed. Practice handling requests, responses, and common errors like port conflicts.

Endpoints:
GET /api/hello


GET /api/greet?name=yourName


GET /api/square/{number}


GET /api/grade?marks=yourMarks


GET /api/format-date?date=yyyy-MM-dd


GET /api/user/{id}?info=type
